Based on agent, verb, target
Distinguish "own" state vs "external" properties: 
  - color and length are internal
  - position is an external property
  - size is external: it is a function of internal state and can take many forms (fuzzy, exact, etc)
  - this allows properties to be added

Basic types: 
object (a sequence of one)
sequence of objects (a tree with one branch)
tree of objects (a directed network with one root and each node has only one parent): it has branches, inner nodes, leaf nodes, rows
network of objects
a table is a sequence of sequences
a table is also a tree of branches of same length, where branches represent columns

class House:
  actions: 
    open door:

      interact with environment (globals -- such as interpreter, filesystem, network, timer)
      context sensitive (there is a default "always" context)
      return object(s)
